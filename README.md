	My project is a landing page for a non-profit organization that I started in Vietnam. From that perspective, my project is meant to serve as an informational page on the structure and services provided by the UPP. As it currently exist, the project is made up of only the index page which provides the user with information, the buttons are currently non-fuctional. My current plan is to continue the project afterwards, adding new content pages, a back-end admin portal to allow for faster dynamic templating for the project and blog section, and fuctionality to the donate button.
	
	Features: 
	
	My project makes extensive use of the following features.
	
	1. CSS Flexbox
	2. Navigation menu that changes/goes into hamburger view
	3. N-of-child selectors
	4. From a JS, shows/hides an element, this is accomplished using an on-click event that adds a class of active to the navigation-links and hamburger menu. So that the navigation-links are transitioned off the screen and hamburger button icon is manipulated to show a simple to close it.
