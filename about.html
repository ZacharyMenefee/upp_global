                UPP Global is a Bermudian led project, currently operating in Vietnam. UPP is an acronym for United
                Peoples Project and is short for the word 'uplifting'. The word uplifting is defined as "inspiring
                happiness, optimism, or hope". This definition is an accurate description of what UPP Global’s projects
                achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                We work towards uplifting and inspiring young people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our primary objective is to contribute to the reduction of youth inequality worldwide, through the
                advancement of sport and education.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, inequality was reported as growing for more than “70 percent of the global population,
                exacerbating the risks of divisions and hampering economic and social development” (United Nations).
            </p>

            <p>We seek to provide new opportunities for all people, with a focus on disadvantaged youth and youth from
                vulnerable communities as a response to the growing threat of inequality worldwide. We aim to achieve
                this through various purposeful projects that are focused on providing equal opportunities for the young
                people that are involved.</p>

        </p>

        <p>
